## Algorithms

The following encryption algorithms are implemented in this repository:

- **RSA Encryption**: RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a widely used public-key encryption algorithm.

- **Twofish Encryption**: Twofish is a symmetric key block cipher with a block size of 128 bits and key sizes up to 256 bits.

- **AES Encryption**: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric key encryption algorithm with block sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits.

- **Blowfish Encryption**: Blowfish is a symmetric key block cipher designed to be fast and secure.

- **Triple DES Encryption**: Triple DES (Data Encryption Standard) applies the DES cipher algorithm three times to each data block for enhanced security.

## Getting Started

To get started, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gurmatsinghsour/Data-Encryption-Algorithms-.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the repository folder:
    ``` 
    cd Data-Encryption-Algorithms-
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies (if any):
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

You can now run the encryption algorithms using Python scripts available in the repository.

## Usage

Each encryption algorithm is implemented in a separate Python script. You can use these scripts to perform encryption and decryption operations. When you run these scripts, they provide additional information, including:

- **CPU Usage**: The scripts measure and report CPU usage during encryption and decryption.

- **Execution Time**: You will get insights into the time it takes for encryption and decryption operations to complete.

- **Bytes Sent and Received**: The scripts monitor and display the number of bytes sent and received during the operations.
